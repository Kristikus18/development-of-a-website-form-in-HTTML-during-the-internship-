This project is a service order form for an auto workshop, developed entirely using HTML and CSS. The form allows users to input important details such as customer information, vehicle data, and select various services. I designed and implemented the client-side part of the project, focusing on layout, styling, and functionality, while excluding server-side logic. Key features include:

Input fields for customer and vehicle data: Includes sections for customer details, vehicle type, license plate, mileage, and service booklet information.
Service selection: Checkboxes are used for selecting various services, such as oil changes, tire replacements, brake inspections, and more.
Responsive design: The form layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Clean styling: Using CSS, the form is styled with a professional and user-friendly design, featuring a simple color scheme and clear layout for easy navigation.
Front-end focus: As this project is a learning exercise, I focused on developing the front-end without incorporating any back-end or server-side functionality.
